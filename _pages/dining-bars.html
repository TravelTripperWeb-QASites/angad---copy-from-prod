        <p>Grand Tavern by David Burke, Angad Arts Hotel’s signature restaurant is Chef Burke’s first St. Louis based concept in partnership with Esquared Hospitality. The ambience is comfortable and welcoming, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, Sunday brunch and pre and post theatre specials. The bar and lounge features a menu designed for diners to share casual small plates and classic drinks. The main dining room showcases Chef Burke’s playful cuisine and whimsical take on classic and contemporary American dishes. Those familiar with Chef David Burke can look forward to his famous clothesline bacon and pastrami salmon. He also pays homage to St. Louis by putting his twist on local classics.</p>
