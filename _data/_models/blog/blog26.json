  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Over time, New York has accumulated infinite layers of history and traditions&hellip; and many, many quirks. While some would consider Madame Tussauds wax museum as the maximum expression of the bizarre and peculiar aspects of New York, we at the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonhotel.com/\">Royalton New York Hotel</a> have better suggestions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://theevolutionstore.com/\">Evolution Store</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forget about the Natural History Museum, a trip to the Evolution Store in SoHo will be just as fascinating. The best news is that you can actually purchase the items on display. You&rsquo;ll find framed insects, preserved and mounted specimens, meteorites, skeletons and unusual toys.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://shopobscuraantiques.com/\">Obscura Antiques and Oddities</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the name suggests, this is another store where you can spend hours oohing and aahing at the assortment of strange, odd and bizarre objects. Although this store is mostly known for its collection of medical items, magic tricks, creepy dolls, masks and so much more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://www.trailerparklounge.com/home.asp\">Trailer Park Lounge &amp; Grill's </a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To have a truly unique meal in the city, go to the original Trailer Park Lounge &amp; Grill&rsquo;s. If the name didn&rsquo;t tip you off, you&rsquo;re in for a kitschy and entertaining experience. The decor alone is worth a visit as you&rsquo;ve probably never seen such a collection of quirky, tacky and just completely random objects. But it&rsquo;s all good fun and the American comfort food menu will be the cherry on the weird-day-out-cake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1528426633398\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_16570/media/2018-06-07-225707/royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital.png\" alt=\"royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital\" width=\"764\" height=\"509\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_16570/media/2018-06-07-225707/large_royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital.png\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_16570/media/2018-06-07-225707/medium_royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital.png\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_16570/media/2018-06-07-225707/small_royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital.png\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_16570/media/2018-06-07-225707/xsmall_royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital.png\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_701_16570/media/2018-06-07-225707/thumb_royalton-strange-and-unique-attractions-in-new-york-smallpox-hospital.png\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.theruin.org/\">Smallpox Hospital of Roosevelt Island</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here&rsquo;s an interesting and slightly eerie location. From the 1850s to 1886, this hospital received patients suffering from smallpox until a vaccine was invented. Afterwards, it was a nursing school until the 1950s, when the building was finally abandoned and left to fend for itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.thewoodlawncemetery.org/civicrm/?page=CiviCRM&amp;q=civicrm/event/info&amp;reset=1&amp;id=303\">Bronx Cemeteries Trolley Tour</a></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Countless celebrities have passed through New York over the centuries&hellip; And many never left. The Bronx Historical Society and the Woodlawn Trolley organize guided tours that cover the graves of many known figures and detail the burial practices of Victorian New York.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After actively seeking out the strange facets of New York City, you might be in dire need of retreating to a perfectly normal spot. Luckily, the Royalton New York Hotel is not only normal, but also sophisticated, comfortable and welcoming.
